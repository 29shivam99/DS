          Thanks for showing interest in my Experience. I am currently working
          as a AASE in Accenture. But this is just about my present. I want to
          go to big product based companies and achieve big in my life. For that
          I can get my hands dirty in programming, be it problem solving or
          development. I have already began doing the things for that but I lost
          my path in between for some time but the things are not over now, it
          has just began. I am on track again.
